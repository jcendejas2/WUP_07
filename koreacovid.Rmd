### Data is from the Patient_Info dataset from South Korea 1 Jan to 1 May 
### This is contained in a downloadable zip file from kaggle

Some of the data was uncoded for sex - sex must be just male or female
77 of the data entries were coded sex  as blank, so we omit these.
state of a patient must be died or alive - we adjust that as well   
  
# Question 1 - Is dying independent of sex

$H_O$: The null hypothesis is there is no relationship between dying and sex.  
$H_A$: The alternative hypothesis is there is a relationship between dying and sex.


Table of patients:
```{r}

# cross tabulation, patient state by gender

with(kRdata, table(Sex, result))

```

## We create two bar charts - one based on frequency and the other on percent

```{r}
barchartGC(~result + Sex,data=kRdata, main ="Frequency Bar Chart")
```

  
### this bar chart is displaying in total frequency terms our data.  Clearly there are a lot less dead people than alive people as is reflected by the sizes of the bars in the display.  

```{r}
barchartGC(~result + Sex,data=kRdata,type="percent", main ="Percentage Bar Chart")
```

This bar chart displays that the percentage of females with the virus is higher than the males, but the percentage of the females dying from the virus is far less than the males dying. 

  
## Numerical results

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~result + Sex, data=kRdata)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```

The table displays that 56% of females that are infected are alive and 44% of males that are infected are alive. It also shows that from the total population from the people that died 36% of them are females and 64% percent are males. 

## Inferential results 

```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
```

The odds of dying if you're a male is 44/1411. The odds of dying if you're a female is 25/1831.  
The odd ratio is(44/1411)/(25/1831). The odds of dying is 2.3 to 1. 

## Conclusions

The p-value from the fisher's test was 0.0009 and the chisquare was 0.0012 which are < 0.05 therefore we reject the null hypothesis. The graphs shows that there is a significant difference between percent of males dying and the percentage of females dying because more males are dying than females.
